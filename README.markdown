# My solutions to Project Euler 's website

**[Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/)** is a website containing lots of problems aiming at being solved.

This is always challenging to solve problems on paper, and fantastic to come up with an algorithmic solution.
I use Python for its simplicity. Simple Python code is very similar to paper solution, and fast to implement.

Each script runs by itself and will directly pop the solution out.

The scripts are named as e_problemnumber_inc. The higher the inc, the finer the solution.

Here is a list of all already solved problems, with a one line explanation.
Should be used in order to help future reuse of code :)

**Note :** I try to get my solutions within a one minute timeframe. What I want here is to solve problems, not get them running as fast as possible. 
So you may find some of the code here quite ugly. And this is the case :). Why optimize something that completely  fits its purpose ? ;)
