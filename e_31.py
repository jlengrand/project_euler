DESCRIPTION: Solves problem 31 of Project Euler
In England the currency is made up of pound, £, and pence, p, and there are eight coins in general circulation:

1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, L1 (100p) and L2 (200p).
It is possible to make L2 in the following way:

1 * L1 + 1 * 50p + 2 * 20p + 1 * 5p + 1 * 2p + 3 * 1p
How many different ways can L2 be made using any number of coins?
