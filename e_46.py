DESCRIPTION: Solves problem 46 of Project Euler
It was proposed by Christian Goldbach that every odd composite number can be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square.

9 = 7 + 2*1^2
15 = 7 + 2*2^2
21 = 3 + 2*3^2
25 = 7 + 2*3^2
27 = 19 + 2*2^2
33 = 31 + 2*1^2

It turns out that the conjecture was false.

What is the smallest odd composite that cannot be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square?
